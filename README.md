The Sharkle widget, as featured in Night in the Woods, now on KDE Plasma! 
Give it a poke and it'll blast out one of eight sound effects while displaying SHARKLE.
Available in black and white versions and can be used with most wallpapers.

(Heads up: This is my first time messing around with QML stuff. Please create an issue if you encounter any bugs!)
